# ðŸ˜Œ Breathe - A Minimalist Mindfulness App

## Description

Breathe is a simple, thoughtfully crafted mindfulness app inspired by tools like Headspace. I created this project as a sandbox for exploring the potential of web technologies with a focus on minimalism and performance. Setting a challenge for myself, I built the entire app using only vanilla TypeScript, leveraging Web Components and the Web Animations API to see just how powerful a lightweight, library-free approach can be.
